Implementation of a "long double"-precision-implementation
for computing convergence-criteria of continued exponentials.
The result is a human-readable output of integer values approximating the number of accumulation points
in a user defined rectangle with evenly distributed selectable resolution.

The results can be further visualized in additional (Mathematica) applications.
